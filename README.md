# HW3
It's the third homework of Natural Language Processing course in Spring 2024 at Sharif University of Technology. It's about sentiment analysis in the level of texts. And also in the level of words, we do NER (Name Entity Recognition). In each part we designed a base model (for example SVM or LSTM) and a tranformer model. Also we collected a dataset for NER task.
